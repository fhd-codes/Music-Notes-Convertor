# Music-Notes-Convertor
Program that converts music notes from [A, A#] format to [Sa, Re, Ga] format


Many of the music pieces are fusion of classical and modern instruments.
For modern instruments, musical notes are written in A, A#, B (etc.) format 
And most of the classical instrument players remember musical notes in Sa, Re, Ga format

To match the sound of both instruments, they should be played at same frequency (note)
This program takes the musical note of instrument when they play "Sa" and converts the given English format notes into classical format.
